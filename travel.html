                <h2>Gunung Mulu National Park</h2>
                <p>Gunung Mulu National Park (<i>Taman Negara Gunung Mulu</i>) is in Sarawak on the island Borneo, near the border with Brunei. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that encompasses caves and limestone karst formations (found both above and below ground) in a mountainous equatorial rainforest setting. The park is named after the 2,377m Mount Mulu (<i>Gunung Mulu</i>), the second highest mountain in Sarawak. Its extensive cave networks houses millions of bats and swiftlets.
                <br><br>
                The park is dominated by three mountains: <b>Gunung Mulu</b> [2,376 m (7,795 ft)], <b>Gunung Api</b> [1,750 m (5,740 ft)], and <b>Gunung Benarat</b> [1,858 m (6,096 ft)]. Mount Mulu is a sandstone mountain; meanwhile, Mount Api and Mount Benarat are limestone mountains.
                The national park has three notable caves: <b>Sarawak Chamber</b>, one of the world's largest underground chambers; <b>Deer Cave</b>, the largest cave passage in the world; and <b>Clearwater Cave</b>, the longest cave system in Southeast Asia and 10th longest cave in the world. Other caves in this area are <b>Gua Nasib Bagus</b>, <b>Benarat Cavern</b>, and <b>Cave of the Winds</b>. 
                <br><br>
                The island of Borneo is considered as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and with at least half of Borneo's known plant, animal and fungi species found in Mulu. Notable examples of plants include the one-leaf plant Monophyllaea pendula, which can be seen clinging to the rock face at the entrance to Clearwater Cave, Salacca rupicola, an endemic palm that grows on the cliff outside Deer Cave and the pitcher plant, Nepenthes muluensis, which can be seen near the top of Gunung Mulu. 
                The park is particularly rich in amphibians, so far not found outside the area. Frogs or toads you may be lucky enough to encounter, include the Api Dwarf Toad, found only on limestone rock in the lowlands and the Mulu Horned Frog found near the peak of Gunung Mulu.
                The vast expanse of spectacular equatorial rainforest presents visitors to Gunung Mulu World Heritage Area with an outstanding diversity of flora and fauna.

                <h2>Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre</h2>
                <p>Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre is located about 25 kilometres west of Sandakan in the state of Sabah, Malaysia. 
                The centre opened in 1964 as the first official orangutan rehabilitation project for rescued orphaned baby orangutans from logging sites, plantations, illegal hunting or kept as pets. 
                The orphaned orangutans are trained to survive again in the wild and are released as soon as they are ready. 
                The sanctuary is located within the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve which covers an area of 4,294 ha (10,610 acres), much of which is virgin rainforest. 
                Today around 60 to 80 orangutans are living free in the reserve. 
                <br><br>
                In October 2014 the centre opened a section where visitors can view the nursery area where the younger Orangutans first learn to be outside and play on a large climbing frame. 
                This consists of 2 large indoor seating areas (one with air conditioning and one with fans only) with a large window that overlooks the play area. 
                Owned and run by the Sabah Wildlife Department, the centre includes facilities such as a clinic, treatment ward and nurseries.
                <br><br>
                If you visit Sepilok, you will have the opportunity to enter the rainforest reserve and hopefully observe some of the orangutans in their wild habitat. 
                These orangutans enjoy the freedom to roam as they please. They are provided with supplementary food which is given to them daily. 
                This additional food is purposefully designed to be monotonous so as to encourage the apes to forage for themselves. 
                <br><br>
                In addition to their rehabilitation work, Sepilok is considered by the Wildlife Department to be a useful educational tool for both locals and visitors alike, 
                but they are adamant that the education must not interfere with the rehabilitation process and so visitors are restricted to walkways and are not allowed to approach or handle the orangutans.
                Areas of protected forest, like the Sepilok-Kabili Reserve, help to mitigate the impact of deforestation on orangutans. Orangutans become isolated and vulnerable as a result of logging and forest clearing. 
                Female orangutans with young are often killed by poachers who will take infants and sell them. The Malaysian Government has clamped down on illegal trading, outlawing all such practice and imposing prison sentences on anyone caught keeping them as pets.

                <h2>Mount Kinabalu & Kinabalu Park</h2>

                <p>Mount Kinabalu is the highest mountain in Borneo and Malaysia. With an elevation of 4,095 metres (13,435 ft), it is the third-highest peak of an island on Earth, the 28th highest peak in Southeast Asia, and 20th most prominent mountain in the world. 
                <br><br>
                The mountain is located in Ranau district, West Coast Division of Sabah, Malaysia. It is protected as Kinabalu Park, a World Heritage Site. The site has been identified by UNESCO as a Centre of Plant Diversity for Southeast Asia, as it contains representatives from at least half of all Borneoâ€™s plant species and is extremely rich in species with elements from China, Australia, the Himalayas, Malaysia and pan tropical floras. There are between 5,000 and 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and more than 100 mammalian species identified in Mount Kinabalu and Kinabalu Park. Among this rich collection of wildlife are famous species such as the gigantic Rafflesia plants and orangutans. 
                <br><br>
                The plants of Mount Kinabalu have high levels of biodiversity and endemism (i.e. species which are found only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). Orchids are the best-known example, with 866 species in 134 genera, including species of species of Bulbophyllum, Dendrobium, Coelogyne, Liparis, and Calanthe, and some of the highly-valued Paphiopedilum slipper orchids. There are also over 600 species of ferns (more than the whole of Africa's 500 species) of which 50 are found nowhere else. 
                <br><br>
                The variety of plant life is also habitat for a great variety of birds and mammals. There are some 326 species of birds in Kinabalu Park, including the spectacular rhinoceros hornbill, mountain serpent-eagle, Dulit frogmouth, eyebrowed jungle flycatcher, and bare-headed laughingthrush. Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain. 
                <br><br>
                The mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the great apes, the Bornean orangutan (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120). Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the Malayan weasel (Mustela nudipes), Oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea), and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Endemic mammals include the black shrew (Suncus ater).
